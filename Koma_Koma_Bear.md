Hi! I' am Wicked. Below is a categorized list of what I want in my biography:

I like Kaneki and [707](https://mystic-messenger.fandom.com/wiki/707). I would love have a dark layout in my profile. You can choose Furuta or Arima too. As I said before, I am very picky and very very picky, so if I tell you it's not good, make it again, don't blame me.

## Skills:

Python programming. 

## Likes:

AAA gaming, Anime, Books, Tea.
 *Side note: You can merge Skills and likes as you like.*

## Favourite Anime genre:
Psychological, Dark, Action, Myestry, Slice of Life

## Favourite Anime/Manga:

## Some more...
 I dont know what else to write. But since you are an expert, i dont see any need to tell you more. You should do something very nice as like professionals do. Nothing else is coming to my mind. But i would like something dark. But before you make it, talk to me about it.

-Thanks,
Wicked
